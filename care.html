              These teams make life easier for us because with the appearance 
              of COVID-19, that the pandemic brought with it, many people work

            <h2>Take care of your battery</h2>
            <p>
              It is important that you avoid always charging it to 100 percent, as well as
              letting its energy run out completely. This is because the batteries last a
              certain number of cycles. full charge and discharge, therefore partial charges
              are always the best option. That is, it is better to charge your phone several
              times a day for short periods rather than once over several hours (such as when
              you leave it plugged in overnight). Therefore, the ideal is to keep it around
              50 percent charge. On the other hand, it is important that you use original
              chargers and accessories (such as charging cables and docks), or certified by
              phone brands, since an incorrect voltage can damage the battery and the device.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, if you want the battery to last longer, keep the screen brightness at a lower
              level; don't turn auto brightness on, instead manually keep it lower unless you need
              it higher; Modern phones with AMOLED screens allow dark mode in certain apps and even
              at the System level. You should try this to save a certain amount of power. A
              very common practice is to use your device while the battery is charging, however,
              if you need to reply to a message urgently, it is best to wait until the battery
              is full to continue enjoying the equipment. If you found this article interesting;

            <h2>Reduce the use of multiple applications</h2>
            <p>
              Let's face it, mobile apps are inescapable. From phone banking to online
              shopping and video chats to social browsing, they remain an integral
              part of using the phone. But having too many of these programs can
              quickly drain your Android battery.Apps consume data and power to
              update. Also, they keep sending notifications and adding information
              throughout the day, causing your phone to constantly flicker and vibrate.
              As a result, the phone battery starts to drain faster than normal.
              Therefore, a viable option and uninstall applications that are not
              used frequently. Also, be sure to disable notifications and app plugins that you can't give up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not occupy all the storage of your device in applications, since you will need them not
              to occupy all the memory, if you do then it is very likely that the phone can become slower,
              this means that the interface becomes slow because it does does. It doesn't have much memory space.
              We will always recommend that you close the applications that you do not use or uninstall them.
              On android devices, it often happens that the applications have an update available, we recommend
              that you update them and avoid errors in them. Finally, we recommend that you always install
              applications from a reliable source, this is the play store, or app gallery, or app store, because
              if you download applications from the internet with APK versions, they may have viruses and may damage your mobile device.

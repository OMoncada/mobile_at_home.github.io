            <h2>Can a cell phone dropped into water be recovered?</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, every day there are many mobile phones that end up
                submerged in water, be it in a pool, in the sea or simply in a toilet,
                which in most cases (unless it has some resistance) results in a terminal.
                that stops working properly or definitely becomes a paperweight at the
                moment or in a matter of days.
            </p>
            <p>
                And surely, many of you who are reading these lines have heard of the most
                common solution to try to remove moisture from a mobile: submerging it for
                hours in rice. But the truth is that rice is not the only alternative, so
                below we are going to repair the practices when trying to make a mobile
                phone survive a dip, in addition to repairs or possible effects on the terminal's warranty.
            </p>

            <h6>The myth of lifesaving rice</h6>
            <p>
                On countless occasions we have been able to read or someone has told us that putting the
                freshly soaked in rice and leaving it that way for 48 hours has saved the device from
                a final goodbye. Rice is known for being absorbent, in fact its use to save wet phones
                seems like a remedy that is transmitted thanks to word of mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, if the myth of rice has gone so far, it is simply because it is the absorbent that we can
                have closest at hand in case of an accident (newly wet mobile). Cat litter (from silica beads),
                oatmeal or silica gel (those little bags that we find in many boxes) are also strong absorbents,
                in which we could perfectly sink a wet phone to try to revive it, but as having rice on hand is
                more common, the cereal is the one that has taken the title. Likewise, all absorbents have a
                limited effect when it comes to possible resurrection of a wet phone. If the immersion is too
                long or in salty water, the appearance of corrosion is more than likely, and there is no absorbent to fix it.
            </p>
            <h6>So, what can I do if my mobile phone has gotten wet?</h6>
            <p>Once a non-waterproof smartphone has touched it, it is very important to follow a series of steps in order to avoid further damage and try to ensure that this accident does not become the final goodbye to our device. The first thing of all is obviously to get the phone out of the water as soon as possible, since the longer it remains submerged, the further the water will travel and the greater the damage will be.

                After that, the main thing is to turn off the mobile, to avoid short circuits that worsen the situation. Due to possible damage, sometimes using the conventional way to turn it off may be impossible, so the easiest thing to do is to remove the battery (if it is removable) or long press the off button or hold the button for several seconds Power and Home keys on iPhones to force them to shut down.
                Once this is done, it is time to separate all possible parts of the phone (batteries, cards, trays...) in order to facilitate easier drying. Once exploded, it is time to dry all the components to the maximum. For this we can use a towel but never a dryer, since what we can achieve with it is that the water is introduced even more inside the phone.</p>

            <h6>The most urgent thing is not to try to turn on the mobile and separate all the possible pieces.</h6>
            <p>
                Here we must make a very important note: if the mobile has fallen into salt water, the salt will have an immediate corrosive effect if we do not dispose of it correctly. To do this, it is appropriate to clean all the components of the mobile with a brush soaked in isopropyl alcohol, which helps to remove any traces of salt.
                Once the terminal has been disassembled and dried, it is time for patience. Whether in rice, cat litter, oat flakes or silica gel, we have to submerge the wet phone for 48 hours in one of these options. Two days during which it is best not to touch the phone at all, so that the absorbent we use does its job.
                After those two days is when it's time to put all the pieces back together and cross your fingers. Despite having removed the phone from the water in a matter of seconds and having followed all the previous steps, no one can guarantee that the result will be positive, since no matter how much we dry it, if the corrosion has made an appearance, we can do little. .
            </p>
            <h6>Is there any other solution?</h6>
            <p>The last option left to us after trying everything is to pay for a repair, but most likely it will not be profitable. If a mobile does not work correctly after being wet, the usual thing is that the device's main board itself has corrosion or short circuits, something that can only be solved by replacing the affected parts, the cost of which can reach the price of a new mobile.
                Now, we can always find price disparities in repairs, depending on which technical service we go to, but as on many occasions, cheap can be expensive. Apart from the fact that in an unofficial technical service it is rare that they can repair the main board of a phone, if unofficial parts are used in the repair, we can be faced with a short-term fix that only wastes time and money.
                The only solution, before we have an accident that we take our mobile to an accidental dip, is to have a good insurance contract. Different establishments and websites allow a change of a safe periodic quota of telephones against liquids, the device being repaired or replaced in the event of an accident. Now, it is convenient to read all the fine print, since we can find cases in which all types of liquids are not covered, in which a franchise must be paid or even that the breakdown is not fully covered.</p>

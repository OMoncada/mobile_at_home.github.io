            <h2>Why do cell phone batteries wear out?</h2>
            <p>
                The battery conditions the use that we give to the cell phone,
            since it is the one that defines the hours of autonomy that you
            will enjoy with your mobile device. On the other hand, depending
            on the model of the equipment, it will have a particular capacity,
            which is expressed in milliampere hours (mAh). Knowing about this
            is key to taking the first step in learning how to take care of your
            cell phone battery, as well as understanding why some drain faster than others.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to capacity, battery consumption is closely related
            to the screen resolution, the type of processor, the use of wireless
            communications and applications, especially if notifications are
            active, since the cell phone remains in constant touch of data to
            be able to display alerts.
            </p>
            <p>Other causes of battery depletion are as follows:</p>
            <p>- Leave the mobile phone connected to the charger overnight.</p>
            <p>- Have the screen set to maximum brightness.</p>
            <p>- the cell phone to extreme temperatures.</p>
            <p>- Use of generic chargers.</p>
            <p>- Example of high energy consumption applications.</p>

            <h6>The battery should be between 20 and 80 percent charge</h6>
            <p>
              Surely you will wonder why leaving the charge between 20 and 80 percent is a good suggestion on how to take care of the cell phone battery. The reason is that going below or exceeding these recommended percentages puts more strain on your computer and consequently reduces battery life. Also, there are some phones with, in the case of the iPhone, where the operating system is designed to detect when it's at 20% charge and send a message to the user that the battery is low, and give them a suggestion. if you want to put the phone in battery saving mode, to optimize the 20% charge, and that's not all, when the phone has 80%, the same operating system detects that percentage and sends a message to the user that it has enough load to be able to operate the equipment, so it is recommended to disconnect it. However, not everyone pays attention to this message, and this is only a system recommendation, since it does not affect anything, since the battery charge cycles will continue until it charges to 100% and advances to the second charge cycle useful life.

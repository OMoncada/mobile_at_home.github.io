      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Provide information on how to take care of your mobile device, physically
        clean it according to its characteristics and, through software if it needs
        a deeper internal cleaning and finally, make a backup copy of the information
        if you wish, since the information (photos, documents, files and applications)
        is always vital to safeguard, in case the phone is damaged or lost. Therefore,
        it is possible to give it a second chance and extend the useful life of your
        smartphone without having to go to a technical establishment, since you can repair
        it from the comfort of your home and without paying anything or a penny.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The information obtained on this site will be useful to all people who have mobile
        devices, who wish to give them a second life, who have suffered some damage, and who
        wish to promote the reuse of mobile equipment.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        The mobile has become one of the most precious gadgets, and when you buy it you
        want it to stay in good condition for as long as possible. That is why on this page
        we are going to help you extend its useful life, or even repair it in the comfort of
        your home, only with the information that we will share here. Cell phones and other
        equipment are part of our daily routine, even when people go to the bathroom they do so
        with their cell phones.
        These teams make life easier for us because with the appearance of COVID-19, that the
        pandemic brought with it, many people work from home, reason for which they must be attentive
        to any circumstance that arises at work and even more reason to have the cell phone at hand.

        These teams make life easier for us because with the appearance of COVID-19,
        that the pandemic brought with it, many people work from home,
        reason for which they must be attentive to any circumstance that
        arises at work and even more reason to have the cell phone at hand. This goes
        beyond, since it is not only due to labor issues, but also many families
        have been divided for different reasons and that is why in the event of any emergency
        they prefer to have their cell phones close at hand. “Technology continues to demonstrate the role
        fundamental role it has in people's lives and the great support it means
        to achieve your goals. For this reason, various companies offer smartphones that
        fits the style of each consumer, providing innovative options and
        attractive at prices accessible to all”, mentions Jesús Hung, director of TCL Communications.

      <h3>Cleaning</h3>
      <p>
        Our mobile accompanies us everywhere and we use it for practically everything, at all times.
        That causes it to end up getting dirty. It gets dirty on the outside and inside and it is
        advisable to clean the mobile from time to time so that both its software and hardware are
        in optimal condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways in which you dirty your mobile every day. The first,
        taking it with you everywhere because drops of soft drinks, coffee, beer or even if we put
        it on our face and our face is dirty or full of makeup fall on its screen. The phone screen
        is accumulating dirt day after day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second, inside. We install everything we want, we receive thousands of weekly files
        via WhatsApp from our friends who are always there, we register on all kinds of pages or
        applications or take pictures of everything that surrounds us and then they are of no use to us.
        Control the photos and videos you have in the gallery. You may have gigabytes and gigabytes
        of images that are of no use to you in the WhatsApp Images folder or videos of your friends
        doing things, humorous videos, etc. It is important that you clean all these images and videos
        that are of no use.

      </ul>
      <h3>Backup</h3>
      <p>
        In the last time we have changed our way of life, we moved to the virtual world
        to contact our close ones, to study, work, buy and even carry out procedures.
        The cell phone has become an extension of us, since it went from being just our
        channel of communication, to also being our channel of action. For the majority,
        more than the device itself, the information stored in the cell phone is a priority.
        That is why we will give you some tips to be on guard against imminent theft of your
        mobile device, loss of information, or damage to your mobile device.

      </p>
      <p>
        The first step before making a backup copy of everything you have on your
        mobile is to use the native backup system. With them, both in Android and iOS
        you have a method to save the essential data of what you have, such as your
        installed applications, calls, settings or contacts, in the cloud. Thus, when
        you change your phone, if you use the same operating system as the previous one,
        it will locate the backup and you will be able to restore all this data. And if
        you don't trust any cloud service, you always have the old but never outdated
        alternative of connecting your mobile to the PC and browsing to the folders where
        you have the files. Of course, then it would be advisable to make a backup copy of
        the copy, and save them externally on a USB or external hard drive in case something happens to the computer.

        <h3>Battery (subpage)</h3>
        <p>
          The battery conditions the use that we give to the cell phone, since it is the one that defines the hours of autonomy that you will enjoy with your mobile device. On the other hand, depending on the model of the equipment, it will have a particular capacity, which is expressed in milliampere hours (mAh). Knowing about this is key to taking the first step in learning how to take care of your cell phone battery, as well as understanding why some drain faster than others. In addition to capacity, battery consumption is closely related to the screen resolution, the type of processor, the use of wireless communications and applications, especially if notifications are active, since the cell phone remains in constant touch of data to be able to display alerts. 
  
        </p>
        <p>Surely you will wonder why leaving the charge between 20 and 80 percent is a good suggestion on how to take care of the cell phone battery. The reason is that going below or exceeding these recommended percentages puts more strain on your computer and consequently reduces battery life. Also, there are some phones with, in the case of the iPhone, where the operating system is designed to detect when it's at 20% charge and send a message to the user that the battery is low, and give them a suggestion. if you want to put the phone in battery saving mode, to optimize the 20% charge, and that's not all, when the phone has 80%, the same operating system detects that percentage and sends a message to the user that it has enough load to be able to operate the equipment, so it is recommended to disconnect it. However, not everyone pays attention to this message, and this is only a system recommendation, since it does not affect anything, since the battery charge cycles will continue until it charges to 100% and advances to the second charge cycle useful life.</p>

        <h3>Water (subpage)</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, every day there are many mobile phones that end up submerged in water, be it in a pool, in the sea or simply in a toilet, which in most cases (unless it has some resistance) results in a terminal. that stops working properly or definitely becomes a paperweight at the moment or in a matter of days. And surely, many of you who are reading these lines have heard of the most common solution to try to remove moisture from a mobile: submerging it for hours in rice. But the truth is that rice is not the only alternative, so below we are going to repair the practices when trying to make a mobile phone survive a dip, in addition to repairs or possible effects on the terminal's warranty. </p>
        <p>On countless occasions we have been able to read or someone has told us that putting the freshly soaked in rice and leaving it that way for 48 hours has saved the device from a final goodbye. Rice is known for being absorbent, in fact its use to save wet phones seems like a remedy that is transmitted thanks to word of mouth. Now, if the myth of rice has gone so far, it is simply because it is the absorbent that we can have closest at hand in case of an accident (newly wet mobile). Cat litter (from silica beads), oatmeal or silica gel (those little bags that we find in many boxes) are also strong absorbents, in which we could perfectly sink a wet phone to try to revive it, but as having rice on hand is more common, the cereal is the one that has taken the title. Likewise, all absorbents have a limited effect when it comes to possible resurrection of a wet phone. If the immersion is too long or in salty water, the appearance of corrosion is more than likely, and there is no absorbent to fix it. </p>

                <h4>Delete apps you don't use</h4>
                <p>
                    This point is basic: the first step in all cleaning must be to put an end to the superfluous. That is, all those applications that you installed "just in case" and that in the end there is a necessary space on the phone. They can even consume your data and battery even if you have never opened them.
                    Have no contemplations: finish with everything you don't use. Apps that have been left unused, games that you tried one day and ended up staying on the phone, remove everything that has no direct use for you. Your phone will thank you (and so will you).</p>
                <p>After unused applications, the gallery left by WhatsApp and company messages is the element that accumulates the most garbage on the entire phone. Because is that ton of photos with funny memes sent to you from the gazillion groups you signed up for really helpful? The same goes for videos: to the dumpster. And without going through recycling.
                </p>
                <p>To delete the WhatsApp gallery you have to do the following:</p>
                <p>- The reel of the application (it is in a folder with the same name as the messaging app, inside the gallery) and review the content in case there is something you want to save . It's always good to make sure.</p>
                <p>- Once you've saved whatever's important (if anything), have no mercy and delete the folder. In case you can't do it from the gallery, use a file manager .</p>
                <p>- To prevent WhatsApp from automatically downloading multimedia content to the gallery, thus preventing it from filling up with "junk" again, you just have to go to its settings and enter Data and storage. Leave "No files" selected under Download over mobile data, over Wi-Fi, and when roaming. This way, only what you download manually will be saved.</p>

                <h4>Extreme case: restore the factory mobile</h4>
                <p>
                    That you did not have enough with the above? If you have backed up all your essential data ( contacts, messages, photos, videos and other personal information ), you can format the phone to return it to its factory state. This way you will do a thorough cleaning and you will release it again. At least when it comes to software.</p>
                <p>Remember that with a factory reset or wipe, the data on the phone is completely deleted . Save a backup first, and if you really want to reset your smartphone, do the following:</p>
                <p>- Access your Android settings and look for the "reset" option. It is usually found in general administration, additional settings or security (every Android is a world).</p>
                <p>- Choose the option similar to " Factory data reset ". This option deletes everything you have saved on the phone.</p>
                <p>- Usually you have to accept several times to reset the mobile. You will also have to identify yourself to proceed.</p>

                <h4>Why not install a cleaner</h4>
                <p>The functions of the cleaners are not entirely true . These apps only eliminate applications from multitasking and cache to "improve" the performance of your mobile. Android is a system programmed so that apps work in the background, and you only have to delete an app from RAM if you don't want it to be working (Google Maps, a game, etc.) and delete the cache very occasionally, to free up some megabytes.</p>
                <p>However, even experts say that this operating system is by itself one of the safest in the world, above Windows or iOS, so downloading and installing an antivirus might not be a strategy that provides much security to his phone; on the contrary, it could cause its performance to decrease.</p>
                <p>In 2019, a report developed by AV-Comparatives, a company in charge of independent testing of antivirus software, emerged, explaining that most of the antivirus apps that are hosted on the PlayStore do not have a true detection system. malware in the applications that are downloaded to the cell phone.
                Although many of them claim to periodically carry out "exhaustive" analyzes on mobile phones, the truth is that they only verify that new applications are not part of the blacklists that are configured by default. Therefore, the promised protection is not real. Antiviruses on Android (mostly) are just advertising applications with a facade full of "pretty" buttons but very little functional.</p>

                    <h4>Learn to clean your cell phone externally</h4>
                    <p>
                        It is no secret to anyone that our cell phones are exposed every day to a large number of external and internal contaminants such as dust, dirt, liquids, images, files, and applications, so it is normal to end up with a dirty and extremely slow device. In this case, the best we can do is carry out a little maintenance, but how can we clean the cell phone ourselves and leave it optimized?
                    </p>
                    <p>Before starting, it is important that you have 70% pure isopropyl alcohol. This element is enhanced for its fast evaporation and non-conductive properties. Wash your hands and make sure the space where you will be cleaning is clean. Remove your phone's case, if you have one, and turn off your device. Spray or pour some isopropyl alcohol onto the cloth. Never do it directly on the screen or another part of the cell phone. Pass the cloth over the screen and the rest of the cell phone carefully and without inserting it into the ports. We recommend cleaning the camera lenses with a lens cloth or soft cloth. When the alcohol or cleaning fluid has evaporated, wipe the entire cell phone and screen with another completely dry cloth. Put the cover back on. You can clean this with soap and water if it is made of plastic, or with a little isopropyl alcohol on a cloth if it has fabric parts.</p>
                    <p>Remember that a clean cell phone, both in its casing and in its programs, is a fast device and ready for anything.</p>

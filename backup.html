            In the last time we have changed our way of life, we moved to the virtual world to contact our close ones, to study, work, buy and even carry out procedures. The cell phone has become an extension of us, since it went from being just our channel of communication, to also being our channel of action. For the majority, more than the device itself, the information stored in the cell phone is a priority. That is why we will give you some tips to be on guard against imminent theft of your mobile device, loss of information, or damage to your mobile device.

            <h2>Security threats</h2>
            <p>
                One of the things why you should back up your information is because there are viruses or threats that can get into your phone. That is why a backup can save you from the loss of information. Avoid downloads from websites you don't know, and don't accept links from strangers, here's a little more about this: Mobile malware (i.e. malicious apps) and malicious websites can achieve the same goals, how to steal data and encrypt it, on mobile phones than on traditional computers. Malicious apps come in different forms, the most common being Trojans that perform ad and click scams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spyware can collect or use private data without your knowledge or approval. Data that is typically targeted by spyware is phone call history, text messages, user location, browser history, contact list, email, and private photos. Cyber ​​criminals could use this stolen information for identity theft or financial fraud.
            </p>
            <p>On desktop or laptop computers, most phishing attacks start with an email that includes a malicious link or an attachment that contains malware. However, on mobile devices, emails only account for 15% of phishing attacks. Most mobile phishing attempts occur through SMS messages, social networks or other applications. Jailbreaking and rooting refer to gaining administrator access to iOS and Android mobile devices. Mobile users can jailbreak or root their devices to remove unwanted built-in apps or install apps from untrusted app stores, but this comes with risk. Increasing permissions can allow attackers to access data and thus cause damage.</p>

            <p>
                We start with the normal and simplest method, which every user can access. We are going to see how to backup photos and videos, documents and files, WhatsApp chats, contacts and applications, all using completely free applications and offline systems. If you want to make a quick backup, the easiest thing to do is to use Google Drive. This allows application data, call history, contacts, device settings, photos and videos (using Google Photos) and SMS messages (MMS not included) to be saved in the cloud. To do this: 1.-Go to Settings> Google> Make a backup. 2.-Click on "Create a backup now". 3.-When finished, all your data will be in Google Drive. 4.-On your new phone or on the reset mobile, enter your Google account in the initial configuration process. 5.-It will tell you that it has found a backup. That copy is the one you just made. 6.- Restore it and that's it, everything will be in its place.

                Don't want to upload your photos to the cloud? No problem, you can always use the computer, make a physical copy and pass it on again when you have reset or changed your mobile.
                1.-Connect the mobile to the computer using the USB cable. 2.-On the mobile, lower the notification bar, press the notification "Charging this device via USB. 3.-Select "Transfer files". 4.-On your computer, access your mobile memory and follow the following routes: 5.-Shared internal storage > DCIM > Camera for photos and videos taken with the camera 6.-Shared internal storage > Pictures > Screenshot for screenshots 7.-Shared internal storage > WhatsApp > WhatsApp Images / WhatsApp Video for files sent and received by WhatsApp 8.- Copy and paste all the files you want to keep in a folder on your hard drive and wait for the process to complete.

            </p>
            <p>
                Although WhatsApp has a system to export chats by mail, that backup cannot be imported back into the application. To make a backup, yes or yes, you have to go through Google Drive. 1.-Go to WhatsApp> Settings> Chats. 2.-Select "Backup". 3.-Choose your Google account. 4.-If you wish, check the box to also save photos and videos. Keep in mind that this will make it take longer to upload and download.

                To recover the backup on the new mobile, you simply have to confirm the restore in the initial settings of the application. It will tell you that it has found a backup in your Google account, so hit "Restore" and let the app do its job.

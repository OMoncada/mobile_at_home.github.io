               beyond, since it is not only due to labor issues, but also many families
               have been divided for different reasons and that is why in the event of any emergency
               they prefer to have their cell phones close at hand. “Technology continues to demonstrate the role
               fundamental role it has in people's lives and the great support it means
                to achieve your goals. For this reason, various companies offer smartphones that
                fits the style of each consumer, providing innovative options and

            <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            <p>
              Our mobile accompanies us everywhere and we use it for practically everything, at all times.
              That causes it to end up getting dirty. It gets dirty on the outside and inside and it is
              advisable to clean the mobile from time to time so that both its software and hardware are
              in optimal condition.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two ways in which you dirty your mobile every day. The first,
              taking it with you everywhere because drops of soft drinks, coffee, beer or even if we put
              it on our face and our face is dirty or full of makeup fall on its screen. The phone screen
              is accumulating dirt day after day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second, inside. We install everything we want, we receive thousands of weekly files
              via WhatsApp from our friends who are always there, we register on all kinds of pages or
              applications or take pictures of everything that surrounds us and then they are of no use to us.
              Control the photos and videos you have in the gallery. You may have gigabytes and gigabytes
              of images that are of no use to you in the WhatsApp Images folder or videos of your friends
              doing things, humorous videos, etc. It is important that you clean all these images and videos
              that are of no use. <a href="cleaning.html">See more</a>

            <h2>Backup</h2>
            <p>
              In the last time we have changed our way of life, we moved to the virtual world
              to contact our close ones, to study, work, buy and even carry out procedures.
              The cell phone has become an extension of us, since it went from being just our
              channel of communication, to also being our channel of action. For the majority,
              more than the device itself, the information stored in the cell phone is a priority.
              That is why we will give you some tips to be on guard against imminent theft of your
              mobile device, loss of information, or damage to your mobile device.

            </p>
            <p>
              The first step before making a backup copy of everything you have on your
              mobile is to use the native backup system. With them, both in Android and iOS
              you have a method to save the essential data of what you have, such as your
              installed applications, calls, settings or contacts, in the cloud. Thus, when
              you change your phone, if you use the same operating system as the previous one,
              it will locate the backup and you will be able to restore all this data. And if
              you don't trust any cloud service, you always have the old but never outdated
              alternative of connecting your mobile to the PC and browsing to the folders where
              you have the files. Of course, then it would be advisable to make a backup copy of
              the copy, and save them externally on a USB or external hard drive in case something happens to the computer. <a href="backup.html">See more</a>
